## AMP-D: Aritificial Manga Panel Dataset

I love Manga, however I don't speak Japanese. A project I've always been hoping to work on is an automated manga translation software. Datasets in this space are rare and the largest I found Manga109 is hard to access and only available for academic research. I want to create a free and publicly available artificial dataset. 

## Where do I find the dataset?
